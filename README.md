## Jekyll

This website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Once you have Jekyll installed, here's how to build the website using the command line:

`jekyll build` or `jekyll b` - Performs a one off build your site to ./_site (by default)

`jekyll serve` or `jekyll s` - Builds your site any time a source file changes and serves it locally
