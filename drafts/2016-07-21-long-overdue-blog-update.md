title: Long Overdue Blog Update
---

Close followers of my blog &nbsp;--<i>gazes upon empty room</i>--&nbsp; may have noticed that my blog has changed.

Perhaps this deserves a little explanation.  I was redoing my website recently and started reading through my old blog posts.  I felt that a lot of them were personal, but not a beneficial read to the public nor myself.  So I chucked most of those and kept a few so that my blog archive wasn't totally empty.

And that sort of got me thinking about -- what makes a good blog post? This is most likely dependent on the type of blog one is running. A good food blog post imo might be a recipe for chocolate chip cookies without the 1000 word novel about how those cookies were the only morsel of joy in the author's life, and the recipe bequeathed upon them by a grandparent with their dying breath. A good tech blog post might be 

<ul>
	<li>confirms the identity of the blog</li>
	<li>is attractive and engaging to read</li>
	<li>makes you think about a thing or two</li>
	<li>leaves you feeling smarter</li>
</ul>

Blogging is hard guys.  I'm trying my best here I swear.
