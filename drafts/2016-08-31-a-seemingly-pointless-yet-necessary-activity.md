title: A seemingly pointless yet necessary activity
---



...

So now I can use my hand to get a grip on my handlebars.

So now I can ride my bike to the grocery store.

So now I can go buy groceries and other household necessities.

So now I can go buy soap and a razor.

And finally shave my yak.
