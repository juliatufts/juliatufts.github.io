title: On VR As a Medium
---

How do we define VR. It's a spectrum, encompassing interactive games to passive films. The necessary quality is that
the audience member must have their perception of reality completely transformed. It cannot be derivative from reality. This could be achieved by sending precise electrical signals into the brain overriding all of the natural senses. Right now it tends to be slapping on a headset to view a digital

It is helpful to identify the points of control and their variability in an artistic medium, in order to find an effective way of expression within it. A variable is any element of the medium over which the audience member 

For instance, VR almost always makes use of head tracking. Direction of gaze is now an important variable that the creator no longer has complete control over. 

We should note that a VR piece doesn't need to use head tracking. You can choose the viewer's abilities in the virtual reality you create. Maybe their headset is embedded in a wall, maybe the viewer always faces forward no matter which direction they turn their head. So long as you replace the visual and aural inputs with virtual ones.

Music is a similar medium in this way.

Think about the canonical symphony. Many different instrument groups playing together. A melody emerges, is passed around, develops through time. Harmonies support, change color. Instrument groups come and go, play together, weave together different lines.

The melody is meant to be the point of focus, but there's really nothing to guaratee that the listener is focused on that. Maybe they're absorbed by an underlying cello line, maybe they're lost in blend of reeds.

So long as their head isn't in the sand, you _can_ guarantee that that melody is not occluded.
