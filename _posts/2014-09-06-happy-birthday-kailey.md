title: Happy Birthday Kailey
---

My friend Kailey is super great. She is very intelligent, thoughtful, trustworthy, and witty. She is also a skilled visual artist, graphic designer, photographer, HTML/CSS/JavaScript coder, and a real wizard. Her cat Sebastian is an endearing creature with a poor set of lungs. Nothing serious, he just wheezes instead of meows. So I made this tiny game where you have a new set of lungs for Sebastian that you have to implant. To set them, just line up and click!
