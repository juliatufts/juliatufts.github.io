title: Challenge Thyself
---

So I thought that I would try to make a lot of things to feel like I accomplished something; that's the plan at least.

My self-imposed challenge is to make and post a Processing sketch every day for 100 days. Right now I'm reading about vectors in the Nature of Code. I am already very comfortable with these magnitude and direction endowed math thingies from studying them in university, but it's good to have practice implementing them in a newly learned programming environment.

Here are some bubbles that move using vecotrs. Clicking and holding on the sketch activates <i>slowmotion mode</i>.
