title: Friction
---

Back to Nature of Code, this time playing around with friction. The balls closer to the center of the screen have a lower coefficient of friction: this means that the friction force is less and so they move faster than the balls with a higher coefficient. The equation for <b>Friction</b> (a vector) is
<center><b>Friction</b> = -1 * c * N * <b>v</b></center>
where c is the coefficient of friction, N is the normal force, and <b>v</b> is the velocity.

Thinking about forces and friction reminds me of that Magic School Bus episode where they're playing baseball on a field with coefficient of friction equal to 0. What a great episode.
