title: Hacker School Day -1
---

It's the day before my first day at Hacker School, so I thought that I would try to get the blog ball rolling before I inevitably become busy and fall behind on it. 

I'm all settled into my new place in Brooklyn with former Hacker Schooler Jeff Fowler and roommate yet to be met Yuri. Both are musicians turned programmers, and I feel quite at home. The apartment is also beautiful with a large livingroom and kitchen area and lots of natural light; It also featues a piano (well, technically a weighted keyboard, but it's quite nice) and whirltub bath.

The past few days have been settling in days - unpacking, figuring out cell phone stuff, buying groceries etc. I've also been reading and coding, mostly the wizard manual <a href = "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> after hearing that there is a reading group starting up about it. I've read through Chapter 1.1, The Elements of Programming, and I think it's great so far. It feels like lambda calculus (which makes perfect sense) but it's extra nice to get to program everything while you learn (this book uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp).

Future Things: 
<ul>
	<li><span>I'm still undecided about what I should work on at Hacker School, but am currently leaning towards diving into JavaScript (even though it's been a while and I need to seriously review) and making a game.</span></li>
		<li><span>Tonight I am attending an informal dinner get-together with the women (and anyone who identifies as a woman) of Hacker School. I think it'll be like a warm up to the first day of school.</span></li> 
	<li><span>I definitely need to start including some code in these blog posts, so I need to figure out formatting that. I'll probably test the waters with SICP first.</span></li>
</ul>
