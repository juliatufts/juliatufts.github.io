title: Processing Everyday
---

I am going to try to post something I make in Processing everyday for 100 days. Inspired by the Gaussian distribution, aka normal distribution, in two dimensions I read about in <a href = "http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a>, I made a spraypaint tool. Click on the canvas to paint away and use the arrow keys to change colors. Press space to clear the canvas.

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/GaussianPaintSplatter.pde"></canvas>

I will be tempted to explain everything I read about in The Nature of Code, but I will resist that temptation in the hopes that I won't spend hours obsessing over how to explain things in the best way and getting my facts straighter than a line. I instead encourage the reader to check out the book itself (a great resource so far!), or consult wikipedia for a more complete and accurate explanation of what these mathematical entities are.
