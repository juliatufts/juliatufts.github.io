More fractals, this time playing around with trees.

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/Trees.pde"></canvas>	

The mouse position on the sketch determines the span and the branching factor. The horizontal axis maps to the span (the distance from the leftmost branch to the rightmost): left to right --> 0 to 180 degrees. The vertical axis maps to the branching factor (how many branches at each step): up to down --> 2 to 7. The minimum branch length to keep generating branches is a function of the branching factor so that the tree doesn't explode in your computer :]
