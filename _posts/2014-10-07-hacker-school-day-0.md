title: Hacker School Day 1
---

So, my first day. Wow. I met a ton of incredibly interesting, friendly, genuine people. The space is an incredible environment, teeming with energetic hacker schoolers eager to work and learn and asking questions and having conversations.

Most of the day flew by in introductions, group discussions about what we were excited about and nervous about, lunch in China Town (where you can get dumplings for $3) and a couple of hours coding. I spent some time reading about JavaScript and coding along to make a terrible loan calculator, just to get the feel of a working client-side JS application (even though I can't seem to get it working yet due to what I believe is the canvas element not being recognized.) In the evening I attended the Monday night talk held at eBay offices where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Lopes">Cristina Lopes</a> talked about her book Exercises in Programming Style and the idea of abstracting style in programming. In her book she writes a simple program in 33 different styles; her talk tonight covered only a handful of them but the overall idea of identifying constraints that define a style, being aware of a variety of these styles and not getting stuck in any one type, was very clear. I also learned more about some new-to-me styles of programming using call-backs and concurrency.

Reflective Things: 
<ul>
	<li><span>I think I let my social anxiety get the better part of me at times, but I tried my best to be myself. I just hope I didn't come off as quiet/aloof or anxious/spastic. Anyways, I tried to roll with it, and in the future I will be mindful of that.</span></li>
</ul>

Future Things: 
<ul>
	<li><span>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs reading group starts tomorrow.</span></li>
		<li><span>I would like to meet more people (go outside my comfort zone on this!)</span></li> 
	<li><span>Scout out other group projects and join one if it sounds like a cool project.</span></li>
</ul>
