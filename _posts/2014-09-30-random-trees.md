ANNOUNCEMENT: I will be adjusting my Processing challenge to accomodate going to Hacker School. I will still aim to do 100 Processing sketches total, but it will be at a reduced rate - hopefully a couple a week.

Here are some randomly generated trees. I thought they had a good Tim Burton-esque vibe, so I ran with that.
