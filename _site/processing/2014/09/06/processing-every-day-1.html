			<p><p>What is movement without acceleration? Not very exciting thatâ€™s what!</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/MovingWithAcceleration.pde"></canvas>

<p>Here are some more bubbles that move using vectors, now with acceleration. Bubbles moving forward are pink, backwards are blue. The color of the bubble increases according to its velocity. After clicking on the sketch, holding the UP/DOWN arrow keys increase/decrease the acceleration. I tried to fine tune this to make the change of acceleration proportional to the velocity - if the bubble is moving very fast, the change in acceleration should be quicker than a bubble at rest. I think I got it looking and feeling better with this idea; although, if everything is at max velocity it might take a few seconds holding the arrow key to change direction, so bear this in mind!</p>
