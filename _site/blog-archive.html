					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
						
						<p>23 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/23/hacker-school-day-14.html">Hacker School Day 14</a></p>
						<p>Today I made an animation in JavaScript. Just press the button to make it start.</p>


						
						<p>21 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/21/hacker-school-day-12.html">Hacker School Day 12</a></p>
						<p>On the current agenda is JavaScript, Elm and Algorithms.</p>


						
						<p>15 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/15/hacker-school-day-8.html">Hacker School Day 8</a></p>
						<p>Back to the feeling of being overwhelmed and not entirely sure what to do. But I’ve been told that this is normal and temporary, so I think everything will be okay.</p>


						
						<p>13 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/13/hacker-school-day-6.html">Hacker School Day 6</a></p>
						<p>My first week at Hacker School went by in a blur. I spent a lot of time reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, programming in Scheme, learning Elm, reading a bit of Javascript, and attending talks on recursion, fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.</p>


						
						<p>07 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/07/hacker-school-day-1.html">Hacker School Day 1</a></p>
						<p>Another long and busy day. First thing this morning I managed to get my practice JavaScript calculator working, so yay (it turned out to be just a syntax error - alas!)</p>


						
						<p>06 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/06/hacker-school-day-0.html">Hacker School Day 0</a></p>
						<p>So, my first day. Wow. I met a ton of incredibly interesting, friendly, genuine people. The space is an incredible environment, teeming with energetic hacker schoolers eager to work and learn and asking questions and having conversations.</p>


						
						<p>05 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/hackerschool/2014/10/05/hacker-school-day--1.html">Hacker School Day -1</a></p>
						<p>It’s the day before my first day at Hacker School, so I thought that I would try to get the blog ball rolling before I inevitably become busy and fall behind on it. </p>


						
						<p>02 Oct 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/2014/10/02/new-york-here-i-come.html">New York Here I Come</a></p>
						<p>I am sitting in an airport waiting for a flight that will take me to New York City. And it still hasn’t sunk in that I will be spending the next three months learning and coding at Hacker School. I have a few ideas for projects I’d like to work on, but at the moment I’m feeling like getting a solid grounding in Python might be a good first step. I do want to make some games and graphics and visualization stuff. It is all very undecided and terrifying, but also exciting.</p>


						
						<p>20 Sep 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/2014/09/20/indecision.html">Indecision</a></p>
						<p>I don’t really know what I’d like to do in life. I’ve just scaled the cliff face of university to discover an overgrown jungle at the top. I have no idea what the best way to approach it is, so I try hacking my way through one path, have second thoughts and double back, then try hacking my way through another and another. Never really getting anywhere, and never figuring out what the right way to do it was.</p>


						
						<p>25 Aug 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/2014/08/25/going-for-a-random-walk-in-processing.html">Going For a Random Walk in Processing</a></p>
						<p>I started reading <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman recently; it’s a book about mathematical principles in the physical world and how to program natural systems using Processing. The very first example is to make a random walker class whose instantiation looks something like this:</p>


						
						<p>23 Aug 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/2014/08/23/getting-the-math-feel.html">Getting the Math Feel</a></p>
						<p>There is delightful satisfaction in experiencing a good math feel. This satisfaction is not only found in solving problems and proving theorems, it also resides in the most basic building blocks of mathematics. It’s a bit hard to describe the feeling that I’m talking about here, but I’ll try to give an easy-to-understand example.</p>


						
						<p>22 Aug 2014 &raquo; <a href = "/blog/2014/08/22/blogging-in.html">Blogging In</a></p>
						<p>This blog is the result of a mental vector field shift; the need to concretize my thoughts and create a presence with them has overpowered the uncertainess of me actually being able to do that. This uncertainess is not a lack of confidence in my own ability, but a tendency to get bogged down with the frustration of never being able to explain what’s going on in my head in a completely satisfactory way. My current working solution is to get whatever thoughts I’m having out there, no matter how messy or incomplete. I’ll be blogging about my progress as a programmer, what I’m learning, what I’m working on, ideas for future projects, concepts to explore, etc. etc.</p>
