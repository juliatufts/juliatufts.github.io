		<h1>Birthday Games</h1>
		<p>My friends are a continued source of inspiration to me. I like to show my love and appreciation by making games for them on their birthdays. Here are three that stand out to me, all made in Processing.</p>

		<p>My friend Kailey is super great. She is very intelligent, thoughtful, trustworthy, and witty. She is also a skilled visual artist, graphic designer, photographer, HTML/CSS/JavaScript coder, and a real wizard. Her cat Sebastian is an endearing creature with a poor set of lungs. Nothing serious, he just wheezes instead of meows. So I made this tiny game where you have a new set of lungs for Sebastian that you have to implant. To set them, just line up and click!</p>

		<p>My friend Sonya is an otherworldly muse. She is very intelligent, charming, creative and amiable. She loves cute little animals, so I thought that I would make something with a pufferfish for her birthday. Click on the sketch and use the arrow keys to move around!</p>

		<p>My friend Devin is exceptionally intelligent, artistic, spirited, charismatic and has great style. He is one of the best programmers I know. Hangouts with Devin are adventures where you're part of a super friend gang called the Chroma Luma Kids. They're the best. Here's a little computer game I made for him, just click on the sketch and start typing stuff! Wow! Look at you code!</p>
