				<h1 class="blog"> Hacker School Day 0 </h1>
				<p class="time">Oct 6, 2014</p>
				<p>So, my first day. Wow. I met a ton of incredibly interesting, friendly, genuine people. The space is an incredible environment, teeming with energetic hacker schoolers eager to work and learn and asking questions and having conversations.</p>

<p>Most of the day flew by in introductions, group discussions about what we were excited about and nervous about, lunch in China Town (where you can get dumplings for $3) and a couple of hours coding. I spent some time reading about JavaScript and coding along to make a terrible loan calculator, just to get the feel of a working client-side JS application (even though I canâ€™t seem to get it working yet due to what I believe is the canvas element not being recognized.) In the evening I attended the Monday night talk held at eBay offices where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Lopes">Cristina Lopes</a> talked about her book Exercises in Programming Style and the idea of abstracting style in programming. In her book she writes a simple program in 33 different styles; her talk tonight covered only a handful of them but the overall idea of identifying constraints that define a style, being aware of a variety of these styles and not getting stuck in any one type, was very clear. I also learned more about some new-to-me styles of programming using call-backs and concurrency.</p>

<p>Reflective Things: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>I think I let my social anxiety get the better part of me at times, but I tried my best to be myself. I just hope I didn't come off as quiet/aloof or anxious/spastic. Anyways, I tried to roll with it, and in the future I will be mindful of that.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Future Things: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs reading group starts tomorrow.</span></li>
		<li><span>I would like to meet more people (go outside my comfort zone on this!)</span></li> 
	<li><span>Scout out other group projects and join one if it sounds like a cool project.</span></li>
</ul>
