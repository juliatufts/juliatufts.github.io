			<h1>Hacker School Day 1</h1>
			<p class="time">Oct 7, 2014</p>
			<p><p>Another long and busy day. First thing this morning I managed to get my practice JavaScript calculator working, so yay (it turned out to be just a syntax error - alas!)</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, today was a bit frustrating. I wanted to do on a project in JavaScript and talked to facilitator <a href="http://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> for advice on where to start. She suggested taking a game I had written in Python and doing it in JS, so I started on that. And then a few hours in regretted it and don’t want to finish it (figuring out console input is no fun at all).</p>

<p>But. I met some more cool people, and went to a talk on recursion held by facilitator Alan O’Donnell which was pretty great and had all the mathy feels. I do know someone who is interested in writing a music visualization in Elm, and I meant to try to talk to them today but I got shy - so I will try to do that tomorrow. And we have our school photos out and mine didn’t turn out terrible!</p>

<p>So I will keep powering through, and try not to get discouraged even if I feel like I still don’t know what I’m doing.</p>

<p>Future Things: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs first meetup tomorrow (and I'm leading an exercise!)</span></li>
	<li><span>Continue meeting people</span></li> 
	<li><span>Continue scouting out other group projects</span></li>
	<li><span>Happy hour tomorrow evening</span></li>
</ul>
