			<h1>Hacker School Day 6</h1>
			<p class="time">Oct 13, 2014</p>
			<p><p>My first week at Hacker School went by in a blur. I spent a lot of time reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, programming in Scheme, learning Elm, reading a bit of Javascript, and attending talks on recursion, fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.</p>

<p>I also went to a few social things including happy hour at a “post-colonial British outpost in Jamaica” themed bar, and demo Thursday where I learned about max recursion depth in Python, and how Pokemon graphics are encrypted using Z-order curves. Oh, and I got to witness a blog being set up in 5 minutes to a rap song.</p>

<p>I’m still feeling a bit all over the place, but am doing alright. My biggest concern is SICP taking up too much of my time, so I might have to drop that for the time being.</p>

<p>Future Things: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Continue meeting people and asking what they're working on</span></li> 
	<li><span>Pair programming with Victor today on the Pair Programming Roulette (so meta)</span></li>
	<li><span>Monday Night Talk at eBay tonight</span></li> 
</ul>
