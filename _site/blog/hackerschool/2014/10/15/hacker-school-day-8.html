			<h1>Hacker School Day 8</h1>
			<p class="time">Oct 15, 2014</p>
			<p><p>Back to the feeling of being overwhelmed and not entirely sure what to do. But I’ve been told that this is normal and temporary, so I think everything will be okay.</p>

<p>I decided that although I really like the material in the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, it wasn’t what I wanted to be focusing on (at least not at the pace things were going) so I decided to put that aside for now.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made an analogue RGB clock. Today I reviewed it with Tom, a facilitator, and we improved the color arc functionality as well as developped a method for calculating the segments of time lengths that overlap in a generic way.</p>

	<li><span>Continue working on JavaScript stuff</span></li>
</ul>
