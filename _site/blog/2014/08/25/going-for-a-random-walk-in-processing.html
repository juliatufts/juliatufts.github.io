				<h1 class="blog"> Going For a Random Walk in Processing </h1>
				<p class="time">Aug 25, 2014</p>
				<p>I started reading <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman recently; it’s a book about mathematical principles in the physical world and how to program natural systems using Processing. The very first example is to make a random walker class whose instantiation looks something like this:</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/RandomWalker0.pde"></canvas>

<p>The above random walker is represented by a single black pixel who randomly moves up, down, left or right with equal probability. I iterated on this example a few times: I first made the random walker into a 10x10 pixel square that changed color over time. In this version it’s easier to see the walker’s current movement and overall walk.</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/RandomWalker.pde"></canvas>

<p>I next made it so that the walker could only walk on squares it hadn’t already visited. This way, the canvas will fill up entirely with colored squares and then stop.</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/RandomWalkerNoOverlap.pde"></canvas>

<p>Looking at these beautifully moving walkers made me want to paint a river with them, so I did that.</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="/Scripts/RandomWalkerDefinedRegion.pde"></canvas>

<p>Here I used multiple random walkers and made each a little less random by setting their probability of moving right to 0.5, moving up to 0.25, and moving down to 0.25. I hope you enjoy watching these as much as I do! I’ll continue to blog about my progress with <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a>.</p>
