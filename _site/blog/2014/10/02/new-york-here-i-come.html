		<h1>New York Here I Come</h1>
		<p class="time">Oct 2, 2014</p>
		<p><p>I am sitting in an airport waiting for a flight that will take me to New York City. And it still hasn’t sunk in that I will be spending the next three months learning and coding at Hacker School. I have a few ideas for projects I’d like to work on, but at the moment I’m feeling like getting a solid grounding in Python might be a good first step. I do want to make some games and graphics and visualization stuff. It is all very undecided and terrifying, but also exciting.</p>

<p><img src="/PostImages/NewYork.png" /></p>

<p>My main objective at the moment is to get focused on something. I’m afraid I’ve been terribly unsure about everything so far and keep jumping around as a result. Other objectives include: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>blogging regularly (even if I cringe at my own writing sometimes)</span></li> 
	<li><span>talk to people (and befriend some)</span></li>
	<li><span>power through self-doubt</span></li>
	<li><span>make time to not stress about things or feel like I should be working</span></li>
</ul>
