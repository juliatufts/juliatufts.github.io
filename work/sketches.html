<p>In 2014 I read a lot of <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman and got inspired to make a bunch of things in Processing. The first thing I made was
	a series of <a href="/work/random-walks.html">random walkers</a>. These are a handful of the
	other ones that I liked best.</p>

<h2>Light Gravity</h2>

<p>These are a bunch of star lights represented by white dots that are attracted to invisible points in space. Click on the sketch to reset. </p>

	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/LightGrid.pde"></canvas>
</center>

<p>Here the star lights start on a grid and follow invisible attractors that rotate around the center.</p>

<h2>Eyeballs</h2>

	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/Eyeballs.pde"></canvas>

<p>To all the vector fields I've loved. Move your mouse around the sketch.</p>

<h2>Meteor Shower</h2>

	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/MeteorShower.pde"></canvas>

<p>Movement with acceleration. This is how the dinosaurs died. Click and press space to reset the meteors.</p>
