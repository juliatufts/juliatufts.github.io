title: Step Sequencer Deluxe

<p>In Fall 2014 I spent three months learning a bunch of cool things about programming at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a> (FKA Hacker School). The last project that I worked on was a simple step sequencer made in JavaScript using the web audio API. Make sure you're using Google Chrome, then check it out at the link below :)</p>
