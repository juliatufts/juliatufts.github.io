<p>In 2014 I read a lot of <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman and got inspired to make a bunch of things in Processing. This is the first thing that I made. You can see some of the other things I made <a href="/work/sketches.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>
	The Nature of Code is a book about mathematical principles in the physical world and how to program natural systems using Processing. The very first example is to make a random walker class whose instantiation looks something like this:
</p>

<center>
	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/RandomWalker0.pde"></canvas>
</center>

<p>
	The above random walker is represented by a single black pixel who randomly moves up, down, left or right with equal probability. I iterated on this example a few times: I first made the random walker into a 10x10 pixel square that changed color over time. In this version it's easier to see the walker's current movement and overall walk.
</p>

<center>
	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/RandomWalker.pde"></canvas>
</center>

<p>
	I next made it so that the walker could only walk on squares it hadn't already visited. This way, the canvas will fill up entirely with colored squares and then stop.
</p>

	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/RandomWalkerNoOverlap.pde"></canvas>
</center>

<p>
	Looking at these beautifully moving walkers made me want to paint a river with them, so I did that.
</p>

<center>
	<canvas data-processing-sources="/js/processing/RandomWalkerDefinedRegion.pde"></canvas>
</center>

<p>
	Here I used multiple random walkers and made each a little less random by setting their probability of moving right to 0.5, moving up to 0.25, and moving down to 0.25.
